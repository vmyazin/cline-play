## Key features include:

Core Tetris Gameplay: Implements classic Tetris mechanics including piece movement (left, right, down, rotate, drop), piece locking, line clearing, and game over conditions.
Hacker Theme: Features a green-on-black color scheme, monospace font, matrix rain background effect, and ASCII-inspired UI elements to evoke a retro hacker terminal look.
Score Tracking: Displays and updates the player's score as lines are cleared.
Game Over: Detects game over conditions and displays a "SYSTEM BREACH" message.
Keyboard Controls: Provides on-screen hints for keyboard controls (arrow keys for movement/rotation, spacebar to drop).
Row Blinking Animation: Implements a visual effect where completed rows blink for 1.5 seconds before being cleared, providing enhanced user feedback.
Responsive Design: The matrix background canvas adapts to the browser window size.
